    <h3>About Mozilla Reps</h3>
    <p>Community is the backbone of the Mozilla project. As the Mozilla  project grows in scope and scale, community needs to be strengthened and empowered accordingly. This is the central aim of the Mozilla Reps  program: to empower and to help push responsibility to the edges in  order to help the Mozilla contributor base grow.</p>
    <p>The Mozilla Reps program provides a simple framework and specific  tools to help volunteer Mozillians become official representatives of  Mozilla in their region. Anyone who is passionate and knowledgeable  about Mozilla and who is ready to dive deeper into the project can  sign-up to the program. The Mozilla Reps program helps push  responsibility and authority further outwards, to more Mozillians,  making it much easier for volunteers organize and/or attend events,  recruit and mentor new contributors, and better support their local communities.</p>
    <p>When joining the program, a Mozilla Rep agrees to take on the following responsibilities:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>represent Mozilla in their country/region</li>
      <li>promote the Mozilla Project and our mission</li>
      <li>build on and support existing/future local community efforts and programs</li>
      <li>inspire, recruit and support new contributors</li>
      <li>support and mentor future Mozilla Reps</li>
      <li>document clearly all his/her activities</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>An open and community-driven program</h4>
    <p>The Mozilla Reps program is open to anyone who is:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>passionate about the Mozilla Project</li>
      <li>knowledgeable of the Mozilla organization, its mission, its products and its community</li>
      <li>willing to communicate to as many people as possible and keen to inspire people to contribute to Mozilla</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Although anyone can sign-up to become a Mozilla Rep, that doesn't  mean you automatically become a Mozilla Rep after submitting your  application. Because Mozilla Reps are entrusted with new  responsibilities and special tools to speak on Mozilla's behalf, to manage budgets, events and swag,  each application is carefully reviewed by the Mozilla Rep council and  each applicant, if shortlisted, must pass a short interview before  offically becoming a Mozilla Rep. </p>
    <h4>ReMo Tools and Resources</h4>
    <p>To make it easier, faster and more efficient to organize/participate  in events, to obtain sponsorship for Mozilla-related travel, to  order/customize swag, to document an activity, Mozilla Reps have a specific set of tools and  resources at their disposal. Find out more <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/ReMo/Tools_and_Resources">here</a>.</p>
    <h4>Who runs the program? And how?</h4>

The program's organizational structure ensures that the program runs efficiently, transparently, and in a participative/collaborative way.
